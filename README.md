# CloudGame: Never lose your saves again

This is a fork of the [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*](http://railstutorial.org/) by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).

We added javascript games that save data automatically in our database. 

After the data is saved users can view their scores in each game's respective score board.
